# DEU-Library
deadlock and/or starvation application
</br>
</br>
In this assignment, using semaphore and mutex the synchronization problem is solved. . The "DEU Library" synchronization problem with details has been simulated and solved. You are waiting at the entrance of study rooms in the library for a long time on exam days at DEU. We are launching the DEU Library application to facilitate this. This will prevent all students from creating long queues and locking their study rooms before they are full. In addition, since the rooms will contain as many students as their capacity, it will provide an efficient and fair sharing. With my simulation and solution with mutex and semaphores, students will no longer be waiting that long to study. We assumed you had a total of 100 students and all rooms were empty initially.
